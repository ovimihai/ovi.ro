										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Udemy.com is an online learning platform that has a lot of interesting courses in many domains and they also provide a platform for teachers to create and market their tutorials/courses.</p>
<p>The prices seem pretty hight at first glance, but if you really want a certain course you can add it in your wishlist and they will notify you when they have promos.</p>
<p>This year they had a lot of promotions, you could get courses for 15-20 $, even now they have a coupon promo for a certain &#8220;Teacher&#8221; at least with this code &#8220;APRILBLAST&#8221;</p>
<p>go to <a href="https://www.udemy.com/u/marktrego">https://www.udemy.com/u/marktrego</a> and check out the courses</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>
